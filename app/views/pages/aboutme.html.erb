    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="just">
    Where do I start? I guess the beginning is as good a place as any. 
    I was born 25 years ago and spent the first few years of my life living in an 
    apartment building in Oshawa Ontario. For as long as I can remember I lived with 
    just my mother and with the resources she had, she did an admirable job in raising
     me. When I was 5, we moved out to a farm in the village of Brooklin (basically the 
    outskirts of Whitby Ontario) where I spent the next 13 years of my life.

    Throughout high school I must have changed my aspirations for a career path at least 
    4 times (no big surprise there) and after looking into Computer Programming, Aerospace 
    Engineering, Law, and Radiation Science; I ended up choosing the latter.  Soon I was 
    off to the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT) and back to my Oshawa 
    roots where I moved back to pursue my undergraduate degree. During my time there I became 
    actively involved in everything I could get my hands on. I organized events through a 
    student club I founded, helped start up a fraternity chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon, 
    volunteered as a Student Ambassador, and became actively involved in the community.
    </p>
    <p class="just">
    Since graduating in 2007 I have worked as a Teaching and Research Assistant at UOIT, 
    ran a part-time online business, and immersed myself in a number of various opportunities 
    throughout the community with local entrepreneurs.     </p>

    <h2>Favourite Quotes</h2>
    <p>"I am not making plans for failure because I am not planning to fail.
    Contingency plan UNNECESSARY!" - General Douglas MacArthur; 1950 <br />
	<br/>
    "Time is freedom â€” freedom to make more money, to give it away, and to be
    with your loved ones. The path to freedom is open to you. You can be a
    worker bee, buzzing around till the end of your days, barely noticing those
    around you, or you can be a free spirit, with plenty of time to seize the
    day and tend to your family. Freedom is yours for the taking." -
    Robert Kiyosaki</p>
